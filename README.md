## ServerRedirect
This Forge mod provides a way for servers to transfer players to another server address, without the use of a proxy server.
By using this mod, server owners can avoid mod incompatibility issues caused by proxy servers like Bungeecord, Waterfall, and Velocity.

ServerRedirect supports Forge, Fabric, Bukkit/Spigot and SpongeVanilla/SpongeForge servers.
